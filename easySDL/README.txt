Welcome and thanks for checking out easySDL!

easySDL is a pretty simple SDL wrapper I'm working on to help make my life usingSDL easier. (hence the name easySDL)

easySDL supports most of the most basic features need to get started with SDL2
and does so in such a way as to be easily extendable to include more 
SDL features. I am in the process of makeing easySDL and it still has a lot
not supported (Renderers, Textures, Fonts, Animations, Threads, more and more)

But I'll add those things as the need and ambition arises. For now, peruse the
code, It's pretty straight forward to those familiar with SDL.
And those who aren't are advised to become so.
